**Demo:** http://financesapi.herokuapp.com/

**Frontend project:** https://github.com/ayslanmarcelino/finances-front

## Developer Setup

1. Run `./scripts/install_githooks.sh` to configure the [project githooks](#githooks)
2. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
3. Run `./scripts/start_app.sh` to raise the docker infrastructure and start a detached development server at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
4. Run `docker attach finances-api_web_1` to attach your terminal with the server process (this allow you to follow the server logs and use [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry))

## Commands

In order to use the following commands, add `docker-compose exec web` before it.

- `bundle exec rubocop` - Run the full suite of linters on the codebase.
- `bundle exec rspec` - Run the tests on the codebase.

To run the commands inside the docker container, prepend it with: `docker-compose exec web`

The step 1 of the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup) configure the following githooks:

- **pre-commit:** Runs rubocop checks in the codebase, if some offense is detected the commit is aborted
- **pre-push:** Runs the tests on the codebase, if some spec fails the push is aborted
